# pascal-for-newbies

My old pascal programs from high school. I saved just few of them. It is strange how
many programs disappear so easy. I hope this repository will help someone to learn as it helped me to start
to develop and understand very basics of programming.

## volume-surface.pas

[volume-surface.pas](volume-surface/volume_surface.pas)

The program calculates the volume and surface of the following : cube, block, sphere, 
rotating cone, rotating cylinder. The program gives you the opportunity to choose 
for which shape it will be calculated.

## del17.pas

[del17.pas](del/del17.pas)

Program read user input number and find out if the number is divisible with 17.

## deln.pas

[deln.pas](del/deln.pas)

Program read user input number and find out if the number is divisible with user input number.

## max.pas

[max.pas](find-max/max.pas)

Try to find maximum from 3 input numbers.

## hello_world.pas

[hello_world.pas](hello-world/hello_world.pas)

Hello world app

## interval.pas

[interval.pas](interval/interval.pas)

The program prints all numbers from the interval, the limit of which is entered by the user.

## interval_ext.pas

[interval_ext.pas](interval/interval_ext.pas)

Extending the program to list all numbers with properties
which is entered by the user from an interval also entered by the user. These are: the divisor 
of all the numbers in the interval, the remainder after dividing all the numbers in the interval.

## interval.pas

[interval.pas](interval/interval.pas)

The program prints all numbers from the interval, the limit of which is entered by the user.

## interval_ext.pas

[interval_ext.pas](interval/interval_ext.pas)

Extending the program to list all numbers with properties
which is entered by the user from an interval also entered by the user. 
These are: the divisor of all the numbers in the interval, the remainder after 
dividing all the numbers in the interval.


## search_20.pas

[search_20.pas](search-num/search_20.pas)

The program reads 6 arbitrary numbers and finds out if there is a number 20 between them.

## search_num.pas

[search_num.pas](search-num/search_num.pas)

We extend the program to search for a number specified by the user.


## radian_values_of_sinus_from_interval.pas

[radian_values_of_sinus_from_interval.pas](sinus-in-radians/radian_values_of_sinus_from_interval.pas)

The program reads the user-specified interval in radians, converts it, and prints the sine values in increments Ï€/36.

## volume_surface.pas

[volume_surface.pas](volume-surface/volume_surface.pas)

The program calculates the volume and surface of the following : cube, block, sphere, 
rotating cone, rotating cylinder. The program gives you the opportunity to choose for
 which shape it will be calculated.
